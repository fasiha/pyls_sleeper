# Windows with Pyls(p) and Jupyterlab-lsp: subprocesses hang until one interacts with notebook
We are writing a Jupyterlab-lsp plugin, similar in form to [pyls-memestra](https://github.com/QuantStack/pyls-memestra), except instead of analyzing code with a Python library, we shell out to an external executable through the `subprocess` module.

We run into a strange issue on Windows (not on Linux or macOS) where, external processes spawned by the Jupyterlab-lsp plugin *hang* without executing, until the user interacts with the notebook, e.g., clicking on a different cell or editing or saving the notebook.

This causes *other* Jupyterlab-lsp plugins to not update, until 

## Reproduction
To reproduce this issue, this repo contains a very simple Jupyterlab-lsp plugin that spawns a shell call to `python` to run a simple Python script that [sleeps for three seconds](./pyls_sleeper/ext/sleeper.py). The plugin prints the PID of the spawned process when it starts, and when it ends.

In Linux/macOS, which work correctly, each spawned PID ends three seconds after it begins.

However in Windows, immediately upon Jupyterlab opening the notebook, the `python` process is spawned but fails to finish, and data from other Jupyterlab-lsp plugins like pyls-memestra doesn't show in the browser. If I click on another cell, then the process reliably finishes three seconds after my click.

As I edit the notebook, the plugin spawns processes and they completeâ€”because I'm interacting with the notebook by typing. If I stop typing and wait, the most recently spawned process will hang, not finishing for seconds or minutes, until I interact with the notebook.

## Steps to reproduce
I create a fresh conda environment in Windows and install pyls-memestra and other requirements:
```
conda create -n pylaguageserver-sleeper
conda activate pylaguageserver-sleeper
conda install -c conda-forge pyls-memestra jupyterlab-lsp nodejs
```

I edit a file to remove an emoji, to fix a Unicode/Windows bug in [pyls-memestra#50](https://github.com/QuantStack/pyls-memestra/issues/50):
```
code C:\Users\traveler\miniconda3\envs\pylaguageserver-sleeper\lib\site-packages\pyls_memestra\plugin.py
```

I pip-install this repo:
```
pip install c:\path\to\pyls_sleeper
```
and start the Jupyter server:
```
jupyter lab --no-browser
```

The notebook illustrated above has the following demo content to exercise memestra and pycodestyle plugins:
```py
import deprecated
@deprecated.deprecated('bad func')
def foo():
    pass
foo()
```

## Process debugger information
Opening the spawned process' PID in Windows [Process Explorer](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/process-explorer) shows that it's stuck at the same function (`ntdll.dll!ZwQueryInformationFile`), with the following stack:
